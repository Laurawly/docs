# Comparison with Other Engines

We compared Gunrock against several other engines for graph analytics:

- [CuSha (GPU)](http://farkhor.github.io/CuSha/)
- [Galois (CPU)](http://iss.ices.utexas.edu/?p=projects/galois)
- Hardwired (primitive-specific) (GPU)
- [Ligra (CPU)](http://jshun.github.io/ligra/)
- [MapGraph (GPU)](https://www.blazegraph.com/mapgraph-technology/)
- [nvGRAPH (GPU)](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvgraph)

Below are comparative results on 5 primitives times 9 datasets in terms
of graph throughput (millions of edges per second, MTEPS) ...
