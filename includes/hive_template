<p>(JDO notes, delete these when you start: The goal of this report is to be useful to DARPA and to your colleagues. This is not a research paper. Be very honest. If there are limitations, spell them out. If something is broken or works poorly, say so. Above all else, make sure that the instructions to replicate the results you report are good instructions, and the process to replicate are as simple as possible; we want anyone to be able to replicate these results in a straightforward way.)</p>

<p>One-paragraph summary of application, written at a high level.</p>
<h2 id='summary-of-gunrock-implementation'>Summary of Gunrock Implementation</h2>
<p>As long as you need. Provide links (say, to papers) where appropriate. What was the approach you took to implementing this on a GPU / in Gunrock? Pseudocode is fine but not necessary. Whatever is clear.</p>

<p>Be specific about what you actually implemented with respect to the entire workflow (most workflows have non-graph components; as a reminder, our goal is implementing single-GPU code on only the graph components where the graph is static).</p>
