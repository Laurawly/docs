<h1 id='possible-gunrock-projects'>Possible Gunrock projects</h1>
<p>Possible projects are in two categories: infrastructure projects that make Gunrock better but have minimal research value, and research projects that are longer-term and hopefully have research implications of use to the community.</p>

<p>For any discussion on these, please use the existing Github issue (or make one).</p>
<h2 id='infrastructure-projects'>Infrastructure projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Containerize Gunrock (a Docker container) [<a href="https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock/issues/349">issue</a>]</li>
<li>Support a Windows build [<a href="https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock/issues/213">issue</a>]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id='research-projects'>Research projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Better defaults and/or decision procedures for setting Gunrock parameters (possibly a machine-learning approach for this)</li>
<li>How can we preprocess Gunrock input to increase performance? This could be either reordering CSR for better performance (e.g., reverse Cuthill-McKee) or a new format.</li>
<li>If we had a larger number of X in the hardware&mdash;e.g., more registers, more SMs, more threads/SM, more shared memory, bigger cache---how would it help performance? (Where would we want NVIDIA to spend more transistors to best help our performance?)</li>
</ul>
